### **Project Overview:**
This project is a user management system built with **React.js**. It allows users to **add**, **view**, and **edit** user profiles, including personal details such as **name**, **email**, **role**, **status**, and **profile photo**. The project leverages **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **React Router** for navigation.

### **Features:**
1. **Add New User**: 
   - Users can input their details into a form with fields for name, email, role, and a profile photo. 
   - When a user submits the form, the new user data is stored and added to the system with a unique ID generated by `Date.now()`.
   - The form allows the upload of images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).
   - Upon successful submission, the form resets and the user is redirected back to the **UserProfile** page.

2. **View Users (UserProfile)**: 
   - A table displays all users, including their name, email, role, status, and profile photo. 
   - Users can toggle the status between **Active** and **Inactive**, and delete users from the list.

3. **Edit User (ManageUser)**: 
   - The system allows for editing a user's information, including their name, email, role, and profile photo. 
   - Changes are saved to the userâ€™s data upon form submission.

### **Navigation**:
- The application uses **React Router** for navigation. 
   - After adding a new user, the app navigates to the **UserProfile** page, displaying the updated list of users.

### **UI/UX**:
- The form and table components are designed to be **responsive** with **Tailwind CSS**. 
- The UI provides user feedback on actions like uploading a photo or editing user details.

### **Key Technologies Used**:
1. **React.js**: Used to build the components and manage state.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and customizable styling.
3. **React Router**: To handle navigation between pages.
4. **FileReader API**: To read and preview uploaded images.

### **Potential Improvements**:
1. **Client-side Validation**: Ensure fields like email and role are validated before submission.
2. **Error Handling**: Include error handling for failed operations, such as user data not being added correctly.
3. **Form Accessibility**: Improve accessibility with labels and `aria` attributes for better user interaction.
4. **Responsive Layout**: Adjust the layout for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth user experience on mobile devices.

This project serves as a basic implementation of a **user management system** where users can be added, viewed, and edited in a straightforward manner, with a focus on **usability** and **responsiveness**.
